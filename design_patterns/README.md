# Singleton Design Pattern
A design pattern which allows instantiation of a class just once.
Implemented in Java

**Problem**

We switch between apps very often. Launching them several times while also switching between different apps.
Here when launching the app its instance is created. While doing, it again and again multiple instances will be created which will take up memory space.

**Solution**

Here the singleton pattern can come useful. When the app is launched for the first time its instance is created.And whenever we launch the same instance will be returned with the state we left it until that instance is destroyed.
